    <p>Reading is my favorite thing to do when I get bored which is quite often. 
      My mom yells at me all the time for not using my time productively and always being on my phone. Here are some of my all time fav books that I can read 1,000 times and never get bored of.

      <p>The summer that Belly turns sixteen, major changes impact everyone staying at the Fisher’s 
        beach house. After the Conklins arrive, the two families begin to settle in for what at first
         seems like a typical vacation—but it soon becomes clear that this summer won’t be the same as
          those before. Belly has blossomed into a beautiful young woman, and both boys notice the 
          change in her appearance. However, Conrad’s moodiness makes Belly feel more distant from him 
          than ever before. </p>
